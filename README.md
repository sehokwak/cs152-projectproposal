# Beverage Nutrition Information Provider

A project proposal for CS152 Neural Networks.

## Project Description

A neural network is trained to provide the nutrional information of a beverage given an image of the beverage. Whether it is contained in a plastic cup, a bottle, or a can, the neural network is able to detect where the beverage is in the image. The neural network is also able to accurately classify the type and size of the beverage using the labels, colors, and shapes to provide accurate nutritional values such as the amount of calories, sugars, sodiums. The applications of this neural network could be used in beneficial ways, such as being integrated into health tracking apps to provide convenient and accurate tracking of caloric intake.

## Goals:

1. To train a neural network to detect where in an image a beverage item exists.
2. To train a neural network to accurately classify detected item in an image.
3. To provide an interface for inputting images and receiving nutritional information on input.
